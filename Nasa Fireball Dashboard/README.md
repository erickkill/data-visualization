# Nasa Fireball


Here is the link to my [shiny dashboard](https://jasonmchlee.shinyapps.io/Nasa_Fireball_Dashboard/)

## Understanding the Data
This is a project on looking at where fireballs were detecting around the world using data from NASA.

We'll work with a dataset that shows when and where fireballs have been seen. Dataset is acquired from NASA the center of sensors.

Columns:

1. date - time fireball seen
2. energy - energy of joules
3. impact_e - total impact energy
4. lat - latitude
5. lat_dir - latitude direction
6. lon - longitude
7. lon_dir - longitude direction
8. alt - altitude
9. vel - velocity of fireball in KM per second

## Objectives

1. Build empty dashboards
2. Create value boxes
3. Build map with data points
4. Merge design elements to single dashboard
5. Connect to shiny
